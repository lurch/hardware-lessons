## Introduction

Using text to command the Raspberry Pi!

## Students will learn

- The difference between hardware and software
- Ways to interact with computers
  - input
  - process
  - output
  - storage
- Differences between Graphical User Interfaces and Command Line Interfaces

## Computing Programme of Study Met

**KS2:**

**KS3:**

- Understand the hardware and software components that make up networked computer systems, how they interact, and how they affect cost and performance

## Resources

For the majority of the lesson, it is suggested that work is carried out by students on a Raspberry Pi each or in pairs. Each student or pair should have access to the standard equipment described below:

- A Raspberry Pi per pair;
- Latest NOOBS SD card with Raspbian installed per pair;
- espeak downloaded and installed on each SD card;
- A keyboard and mouse connected to the RPi per pair;
- A monitor connected to the RPi per pair;
- A headphone splitter connected to the RPi audio jack per pair from lesson 3 onwards;
- A pair of headphones connected to the splitter per student from lesson 3 onwards.

*Note: These lessons will use Python 3*

See the [teacher setup instructions](/teacher-instructions.md) for more information.
