## Lesson 1 - How to interact with a computer

###Introduction
This lesson will give an introduction into using Linux text commands to interact with the Raspberry Pi. 

### Learning Objectives

- Know that computing devices can be interacted with using a GUI or simple text.
- Be able to use text commands to interact with the Raspberry Pi.


### Learning Outcomes

**All students are able to:**

- interact with a computer using some basic text commands without the need for a graphical user interface. 

**Most students are able to:**

- identify the key features of the command line interface and the graphical user interface.

**Some students are able to:**

- Explain the benefits and drawbacks of using text commands instead of a GUI.

### Lesson Summary



### Starter

Split the class into groups and give each group one card from [Computer Device Cards](). Students in the group have 3 minutes to think of how they would interact with that computing device. For example, Smartphone - could interact using the touch screen, microphone, or camera.

Students feedback their answers for further class discussion. Collate a diagram/list of all the ways in which computing devices can be interacted with on the board. Draw out from students that many of these ways are linked to hardware but we could also consider how we interact with the operating system and programs on the device.

### Main Development

1. Display a picture of the Raspbian desktop GUI and ask students to identify the ways that they can interact with it. For example, mouse pointer, icons, navigation bar, and menu system. Draw out through questioning ways of managing files, such as how would they open saved files.

	Explain the key term *Graphical User Interface* and *WIMP*. Explain that in this lesson students will learn how to interact with their raspberry pi using text commands instead of a system that relies on WIMP.

2. Ask students to set up their Raspberry Pi equipment, turn it on and log into their Pi using the default username `pi` and the password `raspberry`. 

	*Please note that students will not see any text when typing the password but rest assured it is working. Why do you think this might be the case? Hint: What might happen if someone was looking over your shoulder?*

3. Load the graphical user interface by typing `startx`. Explain the graphical user interface, before asking students to load a terminal window with **LXTerminal**. From now on students will use text to interact with the pi. Explain that in many ways using text commands is often much quicker and more powerful.

	For example, one command can find the serial number of the Raspberry Pi you are using: `cat /proc/cpuinfo`.


3. Give each group access to or a copy of the [student instructions](). Students are to work through the commands to find the files using only text commands. They should write down every command they use. 

	All groups are in competition with each other. The winner of the quest will be the team that uses the least number of commands to find the files.
